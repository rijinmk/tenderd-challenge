# Tendered Full-Stack Web App Challenge

## Running the App

After cloning the project run this command on the cloned folder: 

```
cd server && npm i && nodemon index.js
```

This is to run the NodeJS Server

After this we have to run the React App server, for that run this command **on another terminal of the cloned project folder**: 

```
cd client && npm i && npm start
```

If the server doesn't run, click on this link: [localhost](http://localhost:3000/signin)
