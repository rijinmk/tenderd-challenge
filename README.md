# Tenderd Full-Stack Web App Challenge

## Running the App

After cloning the project run this command on the cloned folder: 

**Note: I have send the `.env` files through mail, please paste them in the `/server` folder `/client` respectively.**

```
cd server && npm i && nodemon index.js
```

This is to run the NodeJS Server

After this we have to run the React App server, for that run this command **on another terminal of the cloned project folder**: 

```
cd client && npm i && npm start
```

If the server doesn't run, click on this link: [localhost](http://localhost:3000/signin)

## Gulp Tasks

- `css-css-libraries`
  - This takes all the CSS files from the public folder
  - Then minifies, concats, creates `libraries.styles.min.css` and places it in `/src` folder

- `scss-css-components`
  - This takes all the SCSS files that styles the React Components
  - Then it converts it all into CSS
  - It's concatinates after the library CSS (bootstrap,...which ever libraries), so that the libraries are given priority to run first
  - Then minifies, concats, creates `component.styles.min.css` and places it in the react `/src` folder

- `combine-css`
  - This combines the files created above
  - Into one big bundle of CSS, `bundle.min.css`
  - Then deletes the `libraries.styles.min.css` and `component.styles.min.css`
  - Then places `bundle.min.css` in the react `/src` folder

- `clean-bundle`
  - This task deletes the old `bundle.min.css` for the incoming new `bundle.min.css`

- `watch`
  - This task watches all the above tasks whenever a change is made in any of the SCSS files

## React File Structure

The pages folder uses the components in the components folder to build its app, I used this structure to add a layer of abstraction while making each component and not be bothered by other component / pages code.
